```

## 3. Filter()

control + alt + i = make new code chunk

####  **Practice Activity 1**

Use `filter()` to create a subset from `penguins` that only contains gentoo penguins with a bill depth greater than or equal to 15.5 millimeters.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(Species == "Gentoo", bill_depth_mm >= 15.5)
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
